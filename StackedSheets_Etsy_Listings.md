━━ THE NEGOTIATION PLAYBOOK (15 pages) ━━

This is what sets this kit apart. Most debt trackers just give you a spreadsheet. We give you the tools to actually reduce what you owe.

● Why 83% of people who ask get a rate reduction (and how to be one of them)
● Your 4 leverage points: loyalty, credit score, competitor offers, hardship

● Best time to call (Tuesday-Thursday, 10-11 AM — backed by data)
● The HUCA method for when the first rep says no
● Your legal rights: CARD Act (US) and FCA Consumer Duty (UK)

PART 2 — HARDSHIP PAYMENT PROGRAMS
● What Amex, Bank of America, Citi, Discover, and Chase actually offer
● How to qualify: the 3-phase process (self-assessment, narrative, documentation)
● Full 4-part call script recommended by credit counsellors
● Why contacting BEFORE you miss a payment changes everything
● How to protect your credit score during a hardship program

PART 3 — DEBT SETTLEMENT
● Realistic settlement ranges by debt type (credit cards: 25-60%, medical: 10-40%)
● Strategic timing: end of month, end of quarter, December (the best month)
● What to say and what NOT to say (critical — one wrong sentence can reset your statute of limitations)
● The 1099-C tax trap and how the insolvency exception can eliminate it
● 5 essential clauses every written settlement agreement must contain
● DIY settlement vs professional firms: honest comparison

APPENDIX — 3 READY-TO-SEND LETTER TEMPLATES

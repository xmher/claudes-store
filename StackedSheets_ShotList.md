# StackedSheets — Etsy Listing Images: Shot List & Canva Guide

## What's in this folder

I've generated 9 Canva-ready images from LibreOffice renders. These are good for
"What's Inside" compositions, feature callouts, and filler images. But for the
HERO images (listings 1 and 2 especially), you want real Excel Online screenshots.

### Generated images (ready to use in Canva):
- `canva_01_dashboard_hero.png` — Dashboard top section (title, date, debts)
- `canva_02_dashboard_full.png` — Full dashboard composite
- `canva_03_debts_tab.png` — Debts entry tab with sample data
- `canva_04_snowflakes.png` — Snowflakes bonus payment tracker
- `canva_05_milestones.png` — Milestones tab with payoff tracking
- `canva_06_guide_cover.jpg` — Debt Payoff Guide cover page
- `canva_07_playbook_cover.jpg` — Negotiation Playbook cover page
- `canva_08_guide_toc.jpg` — Guide table of contents
- `canva_09_playbook_toc.jpg` — Playbook table of contents

## YOUR EXCEL ONLINE SHOT LIST

Open the Example spreadsheet in Excel Online. For each shot:
- Zoom to 100%
- Hide the formula bar (View > Formula Bar, untick)
- Use full screen if possible (Ctrl+Shift+F1 or View > Full Screen)
- Take the screenshot with Windows Snipping Tool (Win+Shift+S) or Mac (Cmd+Shift+4)

### Shot 1: Dashboard Hero
- Tab: Dashboard
- What to capture: From the "DEBT PAYOFF TRACKER" header down to the $39,300 / $1,021 row
- This is your MOST IMPORTANT image — it's what appears in search results

### Shot 2: Dashboard Bottom
- Tab: Dashboard
- Scroll down to the "SNOWBALL VS AVALANCHE" comparison table
- Capture the comparison (Total Interest, Months, Free Date) + the "Avalanche saves you $1,125" line
- This sells the value of the tool

### Shot 3: Debts Tab
- Tab: Debts
- Capture the full debt entry area with all 5 sample debts
- Shows the emoji categories and clean layout

### Shot 4: What-If Scenarios
- Tab: What-If
- Capture the 4 scenario columns showing different extra payment amounts
- This is a unique feature most competitors don't have

### Shot 5: Countdown Tab (BONUS)
- Tab: Countdown
- Capture the big countdown number and the achievement badges area
- This is visually exciting and different from typical spreadsheets

### Shot 6: Snowflakes Tab
- Tab: Snowflakes
- Quick capture showing the bonus payment tracker
- Shows the Tax Refund / Year-End Bonus sample entries

### Shot 7: Milestones Tab
- Tab: Milestones

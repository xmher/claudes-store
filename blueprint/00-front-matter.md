# THE DEBT FREEDOM BLUEPRINT

## A Step-by-Step System to Eliminate Your Debt — For Good

**By StackedSheets**

## DEDICATION

To everyone carrying the weight of debt and the courage to do something about it.

To the late-night spreadsheet warriors, the side-hustle grinders, and the parents choosing between what they need and what they owe.

This isn't just a guide. It's your exit plan.

You didn't get into debt overnight. You won't get out overnight. But you *will* get out — one payment, one strategy, one decision at a time.

Your future self is already grateful you started.

**Keep stacking. Keep going.**

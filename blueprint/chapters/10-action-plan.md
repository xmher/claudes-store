# Chapter 10 — Your 30/60/90-Day Action Plan

## Your implementation roadmap — start today

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

You've read the strategies. You've seen the math. You know the psychology.

Now it's time to do the work.

This chapter takes everything from the previous nine chapters and organizes it into a concrete, day-by-day implementation plan. No more "I'll start Monday." No more planning to plan. This is the checklist.

**The transformation:** You'll go from "I know what to do" to "I'm doing it" — with a clear roadmap for the first 90 days and milestones for the year ahead.

## Day 1: The 30-Minute Quick Start

Do these five things today. Right now. Before you close this book.

- [ ] **Pull your credit report** — US: AnnualCreditReport.com / UK: ClearScore app (5 minutes to sign up)
- [ ] **List your top 3 debts** by balance — just the creditor, balance, and APR. Write them on a sticky note.
- [ ] **Open a high-yield savings account** for your emergency fund (US: Ally, Marcus / UK: Chase UK, Monzo) — most take under 10 minutes online
- [ ] **Set up a $25/week auto-transfer** to that savings account — your emergency fund starts building *today*
- [ ] **Download or open the StackedSheets Debt Payoff Tracker** — you don't have to fill it in yet, just have it ready

**Time required: 30 minutes.**

You've now done more than 75% of people in debt will ever do.

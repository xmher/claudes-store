# Appendix B — Letter & Script Templates

---

## Template 1: Credit Card Rate Reduction Request (Phone Script)

**When to use:** Call the number on the back of your card. Ask for the retention department.

---

> "Hi, my name is [Your Name] and my account number ends in [last 4 digits].
>
> I've been a customer since [year] and I've maintained a good payment history. I've been reviewing my accounts and I've noticed that my current APR of [X]% is significantly higher than what I'm seeing from competitors.
>
> I recently received a pre-qualified offer from [competitor name] at [lower rate]%. I'd prefer to stay with [card issuer], but I need my rate to be more competitive.
>
> Is there anything you can do to lower my APR?"

**If they offer a temporary reduction:** "Thank you. I'll take that. Can you also tell me when this temporary rate expires so I can follow up?"

**If they say no:** "I understand. Can you connect me with someone in the retention or loyalty department who might have more flexibility?"

**If still no:** "Thank you for your time." (Hang up. Call back tomorrow — different representative, different result.)

---

## Template 2: Hardship Program Request (Phone Script)

**When to use:** If you've experienced job loss, medical emergency, reduced hours, or financial hardship.

---

> "Hi, my name is [Your Name] and my account number ends in [last 4 digits].
>
> I'm calling because I've recently experienced [specific hardship: job loss / medical emergency / significant reduction in hours / natural disaster]. I'm committed to honoring my obligation and paying my balance, but I need temporary assistance to remain current on my payments.
>
> Do you have a financial hardship or relief program I could enroll in?"

**Follow-up questions to ask:**
- "What will my new APR be during the program?"
- "How long does the program last?"
- "Will my account be reported as current to the credit bureaus?"
- "Will any late fees or penalties be waived?"
- "What happens at the end of the program period?"
- "What documentation do you need from me?"

## Template 3: Rate Reduction Request (Written Letter)

**When to use:** If you prefer a written approach or want documentation.

---

> [Your Name]
> [Your Address]
> [City, State/County, Zip/Postcode]
> [Date]
>
> [Credit Card Company Name]
> [Customer Service Address]
>
> **Re: Request for APR Reduction — Account ending in [XXXX]**
>
> Dear Customer Service Team,
>
> I am writing to request a reduction in the Annual Percentage Rate on my account ending in [last 4 digits]. I have been a loyal customer since [year] and have maintained a consistent history of on-time payments.
>
> My current APR of [X]% is significantly above the competitive rates being offered by other issuers. I have received a pre-qualified offer at [Y]% from [competitor name].
>
> I value my relationship with [card issuer] and would prefer to continue as your customer. However, I respectfully request that my APR be reduced to [target rate]% to remain competitive with current market offers.
>
> Thank you for your prompt attention to this request. I can be reached at [phone number] or [email address].
>
> Sincerely,
> [Your Name]

## Template 4: Medical Bill Negotiation (Phone Script)

**When to use:** After receiving a medical bill, before it goes to collections.

---

> "Hi, my name is [Your Name] and I'm calling about account number [XXXX] / a bill dated [date] for [amount].
>
> First, I'd like to request a fully itemized bill with CPT codes for all charges. I want to review the specific procedures and costs.
>
> Second, I'd like to ask about your Financial Assistance Program. Can you tell me the eligibility requirements and send me an application?
>
> [If not eligible for assistance:]
>
> I've reviewed the fair market prices for these procedures in my area using the FAIR Health database, and I believe the charges on my bill are above the typical rate. I'd like to discuss a reduction.
>
> I'm able to pay $[lump sum amount] today to settle this bill in full. Would that be acceptable?"

**Key points:**
- Always request the itemized bill first — errors are common
- Apply for Financial Assistance *before* negotiating a reduced price
- If offering a lump sum, start at 40–50% of the bill and negotiate upward if needed
- Get any agreed settlement amount in writing before you pay

## Template 5: Debt Verification Request (Written Letter — for Collections)

**When to use:** When contacted by a debt collector. You have 30 days from first contact to request verification.

---

> [Your Name]
> [Your Address]
> [City, State/County, Zip/Postcode]
> [Date]
>
> [Collection Agency Name]
> [Collection Agency Address]
>
> **Re: Debt Verification Request — Reference Number [XXXX]**
>
> Dear Sir or Madam,
>
> I am writing in response to your communication dated [date] regarding an alleged debt in the amount of $[amount].
>
> Pursuant to my rights under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (15 U.S.C. § 1692g), I am requesting that you provide verification of this debt, including:
>
> 1. The name of the original creditor
> 2. The original account number
> 3. The amount of the original debt at the time it was transferred to your agency
> 4. An itemization of all fees, interest, and charges added since the original balance
> 5. Proof that you are authorized to collect this debt in my state
> 6. A copy of the original signed agreement or contract
>
> Please cease all collection activities on this account until you have provided the above verification as required by law.
>
> Sincerely,
> [Your Name]

*Note: Send via certified mail with return receipt requested. Keep a copy of everything.*

**UK equivalent:** Under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 (Section 78), you can request a copy of the original credit agreement. If the creditor cannot produce it, the debt becomes unenforceable.

## Template 6: Settlement Offer (Written Letter — for Collections)

**When to use:** When you have cash available to settle a collection account for less than the full balance.

---

> [Your Name]
> [Your Address]
> [City, State/County, Zip/Postcode]
> [Date]
>
> [Collection Agency Name]
> [Collection Agency Address]
>
> **Re: Settlement Offer — Account Reference [XXXX]**
>
> Dear Sir or Madam,
>
> I am writing regarding the above-referenced account with an alleged balance of $[full amount].
>
> I am prepared to resolve this matter with a one-time lump sum payment of **$[settlement amount]** as full and final satisfaction of this debt. This offer is contingent upon the following conditions:
>
> 1. This payment constitutes full and complete satisfaction of the debt — no further amounts will be due
> 2. You will report the account to all credit bureaus as **"Paid in Full"** or **"Settled in Full"**
> 3. You will provide written confirmation of this agreement prior to my remittance of payment
>
> This offer is valid for 15 days from the date of this letter. Please respond in writing to confirm acceptance of these terms.
>
> Sincerely,
> [Your Name]

**Critical rules:**
- Start your offer at 25–30% of the balance. Expect to settle at 40–50%.
- NEVER pay until you have the agreement in writing
- Pay by cashier's check or one-time electronic payment — never give ongoing bank access
- Keep all correspondence for your records

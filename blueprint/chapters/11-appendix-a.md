## Balance Transfer Break-Even Table

*Does the transfer fee cost less than the interest you'll save?*

| Balance | Current APR | Transfer Fee | 0% Period | Interest Saved | Net Benefit |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $3,000 | 22% | 3% ($90) | 15 months | $825 | **+$735** |
| $3,000 | 22% | 5% ($150) | 21 months | $1,155 | **+$1,005** |
| $5,000 | 22% | 3% ($150) | 15 months | $1,375 | **+$1,225** |
| $5,000 | 25% | 5% ($250) | 21 months | $2,188 | **+$1,938** |
| $8,000 | 22% | 3% ($240) | 15 months | $2,200 | **+$1,960** |
| $8,000 | 25% | 5% ($400) | 21 months | $3,500 | **+$3,100** |
| $10,000 | 22% | 3% ($300) | 15 months | $2,750 | **+$2,450** |
| $10,000 | 25% | 5% ($500) | 21 months | $4,375 | **+$3,875** |
| $15,000 | 25% | 5% ($750) | 21 months | $6,563 | **+$5,813** |

*Formula: Interest Saved = Balance × Current APR × (Promo Months ÷ 12). Net Benefit = Interest Saved – Transfer Fee.*

**Key insight:** Balance transfers are almost always worthwhile. Even the most expensive fee (5%) pays for itself within 2–3 months at typical credit card rates.

## Debt-to-Income Ratio Ranges

| DTI Range | Classification | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| **Under 15%** | Manageable | Comfortable room to accelerate. Solid position. |
| **15–25%** | Getting Tight | Workable but limited flexibility. Be strategic. |
| **25–35%** | Stressed | One unexpected expense away from trouble. Prioritize emergency fund + rate negotiation. |
| **35–50%** | Danger Zone | Most income committed to debt. Professional advice recommended. |
| **Over 50%** | Crisis | Contact nonprofit credit counselor. US: nfcc.org / UK: stepchange.org |

*Formula: DTI = (Total Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Gross Monthly Income) × 100*

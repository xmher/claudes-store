# Chapter 6 — Your Credit Score During Payoff

## Why paying off debt can temporarily hurt your score — and what to do about it

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

Here's something nobody warns you about: the first few months of aggressively paying off debt, your credit score might actually *drop*.

This feels like a cruel joke. You're doing the responsible thing. You're making sacrifices. And the system punishes you for it?

Not exactly. Your credit score isn't a measure of your financial virtue — it's an algorithm that predicts whether you'll default on a *future* loan. It rewards active, diversified borrowing. So when you close accounts, reduce your credit mix, or shift your utilization ratios, the algorithm temporarily recalculates — and the result isn't always what you'd expect.

This chapter explains exactly why this happens, how to minimize the dip, and why the temporary score fluctuation is completely irrelevant compared to the permanent freedom of being debt-free.

**The transformation:** You'll go from panicking about score changes to understanding exactly what the algorithm wants — and knowing when to care and when to ignore it.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Understand Credit Utilization (The Biggest Factor)

Credit utilization is the percentage of your available revolving credit that you're actually using. It accounts for **30% of your FICO score** and **20% of your VantageScore** — making it the most volatile and most controllable factor.

**The formula:**

**Utilization = Total Revolving Balances ÷ Total Revolving Credit Limits × 100**

Lenders want this number **below 30%**. Premium scores typically show **single-digit utilization** (under 10%).

**How payoff helps utilization:**

When you pay down credit card balances while keeping accounts open, you're shrinking the numerator (balances) while maintaining the denominator (credit limits). This *improves* your utilization rapidly.

**Example:**
- You have two cards: Card A ($3,000 balance, $5,000 limit) and Card B ($0 balance, $5,000 limit)
- Total utilization: $3,000 ÷ $10,000 = **30%**
- You pay Card A down to $1,000: New utilization: $1,000 ÷ $10,000 = **10%**
- Score impact: Significant improvement within 30–45 days

This is the good news. Paying down balances while keeping accounts open is one of the *fastest* ways to improve your score.

### Step 2: The Denominator Effect (Why Closing Cards Hurts)

Now for the trap. Many people, upon paying off a credit card, immediately close the account. It feels good — like slamming a door on a bad chapter. But the algorithm sees it differently.

**What happens when you close a paid-off card:**

You've just removed that card's credit limit from the denominator of the utilization equation. If you carry *any* balance on other cards, your utilization ratio instantly spikes.

**Worked Example:**

| Scenario | Card A | Card B | Total Utilization |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Before** | $1,800 balance / $4,000 limit | $0 balance / $6,000 limit | $1,800 ÷ $10,000 = **18%** |
| **Close Card B** | $1,800 balance / $4,000 limit | CLOSED | $1,800 ÷ $4,000 = **45%** |

Your utilization jumped from 18% to **45%** — without spending a single additional dollar. The algorithm registers this as a dramatic increase in risk, and your score drops accordingly.

**The rule:** After paying off a credit card, **keep the account open**. Use it once every few months for a small purchase (a coffee, a tank of petrol) and pay it off immediately. This keeps the account active, the credit limit available, and your utilization low.

**The only exceptions for closing a card:**
- It has an annual fee you can't justify (try asking to downgrade to a no-fee version first)
- You genuinely cannot trust yourself not to use it (in this case, the behavioral risk outweighs the score impact)

### Step 3: The Installment Loan Paradox

Here's the second counterintuitive score behavior: when you make the *final payment* on an installment loan (auto loan, student loan, personal loan), your score often dips.

**Why?**

Installment loans close automatically when paid off. Unlike credit cards, you can't keep them "open" at a zero balance. When the account closes:

1. **Your credit mix changes.** The scoring algorithm rewards having a diverse mix of account types — revolving (credit cards) AND installment (loans). Paying off your only installment loan reduces this diversity.

2. **You lose an "active" account.** The algorithm values ongoing, demonstrated management of different credit types. A paid-off loan becomes a closed account — still visible on your report but no longer contributing to your active management profile.

**The credit mix factor** accounts for **10% of your FICO score**. It's not huge, but combined with utilization changes, it can produce a noticeable dip.

**What to do about it:** Nothing. Seriously. Never keep an installment loan open and pay extra interest just to preserve your credit score. The dip is temporary (usually recovering within 2–4 months). The freedom from debt is permanent. Pay it off and celebrate.

### Step 4: Know the Score Recovery Timeline

If your score dips during debt payoff, here's what to expect:

| Event | Typical Dip | Recovery Time |
|---|---|---|
| Closing a credit card (with other balances active) | 15–40 points | 2–6 months |
| Paying off an installment loan | 5–20 points | 1–4 months |
| Balance transfer (new hard inquiry + new account) | 5–15 points | 2–3 months |
| Paying down utilization from 50%+ to under 10% | +30–80 points (improvement) | 30–45 days |

**The pattern:** Short-term dips from account closures are temporary. Long-term improvement from lower balances is permanent. Every month of on-time payments and declining balances pushes your score higher.

**After debt payoff is complete,** most people see their credit scores reach their all-time highs within 6–12 months. The combination of low utilization, a clean payment history, and aging accounts is exactly what the algorithm rewards.

### Step 5: Optimize Your Payoff Order for Credit Health

If maintaining your credit score during payoff matters to you (for example, you plan to apply for a mortgage soon), here are adjustments you can make:

1. **Pay down credit card balances before paying off installment loans** — this improves utilization (the biggest factor) before triggering the installment loan closure dip
2. **Keep all credit card accounts open** — even at $0 balance
3. **If using a balance transfer,** keep the old card open and don't close it
4. **Avoid opening new credit** during your payoff phase — each application triggers a hard inquiry (small dip) and lowers your average account age
5. **If you must apply for credit** (mortgage, necessary auto loan), try to do it either before starting aggressive payoff or after you've cleared most debts and your score has recovered

> **TIP:** If you're NOT planning any major credit applications (mortgage, auto loan, apartment rental) in the next 12 months, stop checking your score obsessively. The temporary fluctuations during payoff are meaningless noise. Focus on the payoff. Your score will catch up.

### Step 6: Monitor for Free

Continuous monitoring during debt payoff ensures your balances are being reported correctly and catches any errors early.

**United States — Free Monitoring:**

| Service | Bureau(s) | Score Model | Frequency | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Experian App | Experian | FICO 8 | Daily | Hard inquiry alerts |
| Credit Karma | TransUnion + Equifax | VantageScore 3.0 | Weekly | Score simulator |
| AnnualCreditReport.com | All three | N/A (full report) | 6x/year (Equifax through Dec 2026) | Full report with all accounts |

**United Kingdom — Free Monitoring:**

| Service | Agency | Score Scale | Key Feature |
|---|---|---|---|
| ClearScore | Equifax | 0–700 | Weekly reports, approval odds |
| Credit Karma UK | TransUnion | 0–710 | Score simulator, error flagging |
| Experian App | Experian | 0–999 | Real-time alerts, used by most UK lenders |
| MSE Credit Club | TransUnion | 0–710 | Soft-check eligibility (no credit impact) |

**Important UK note:** Each UK agency uses a different scoring scale. A 600 on Experian (out of 999) is NOT the same as a 600 on ClearScore (out of 700). Don't compare across agencies — track your trend within *one* agency over time.

## Worked Example: Score Behavior During the Martinez Payoff

Let's track what happens to the Martinez family's credit score as they execute their debt payoff:

**Starting scores:** Carlos: 648 / Maria: 672

| Month | Event | Carlos's Score | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Start payoff plan | 648 | High utilization (68%) |
| 2 | Pay off Medical Collections ($340) | 655 (+7) | Collections account resolved |
| 5 | Credit card balances dropping | 672 (+24) | Utilization falling (52% → 38%) |
| 9 | Target RedCard paid to $0 (kept open) | 701 (+29) | Utilization drops to 22% |
| 14 | Chase Visa paid to $0 (kept open) | 728 (+27) | Utilization hits 0% on revolving |
| 24 | Auto loan paid off (closed) | 718 (–10) | Credit mix reduced, loan closed |
| 26 | Score recovers | 735 (+17) | Algorithm recalibrates |
| 36 | All non-mortgage debt cleared | 751 | Clean history, low utilization, aged accounts |

**The pattern:** Steady improvement from months 1–14 as card balances drop. Brief dip at month 24 when the auto loan closes. Full recovery by month 26. All-time high by month 36.

Carlos went from **648 to 751** — a 103-point improvement — while paying off $55,740 in debt. The temporary dips along the way were invisible noise in the larger trend.

## Key Takeaways

- **Paying down credit card balances** is the fastest way to improve your score — lower utilization = higher score within 30–45 days
- **Don't close paid-off credit cards** — the "denominator effect" can spike your utilization ratio and drop your score, even though you spent nothing
- **Installment loan payoffs** cause temporary dips (5–20 points) due to credit mix changes — this is normal and recovers in 1–4 months
- **Never keep a loan open just for your credit score** — the interest cost far exceeds any score benefit
- **Monitor for free** using Experian, Credit Karma, and AnnualCreditReport.com (US) or ClearScore, Credit Karma UK, and Experian app (UK)
- **The long game always wins:** Debt-free people with clean payment histories consistently reach their highest credit scores within 6–12 months of completing payoff

## Quick Win (30–60 Minutes)

**Check your current credit utilization and identify quick improvements:**

1. Log into Credit Karma (US) or ClearScore (UK)
2. Find your total revolving balances and total credit limits
3. Calculate your utilization: Balances ÷ Limits × 100
4. If it's above 30%, identify which card payment would bring it below 30% fastest
5. If you've already paid off a card, verify it's still showing as "open" on your report — if it was accidentally closed, call the issuer

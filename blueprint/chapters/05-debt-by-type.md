# Chapter 5 — Debt by Type

## Specific strategies for every kind of debt you carry

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

Not all debt behaves the same way. A credit card balance and a student loan are fundamentally different animals — different interest structures, different legal protections, different negotiation opportunities, and different traps.

The general strategies in Chapters 3 and 4 give you a framework. This chapter gives you the specifics. It covers the seven most common types of consumer debt, with tailored tactics for each one — including data, opportunities, and mistakes to avoid that are specific to each debt type.

Think of this chapter as your reference guide. Read the sections that apply to you now, and bookmark the rest for later.

**The transformation:** You'll go from a one-size-fits-all approach to a targeted strategy for each debt in your portfolio.

## Credit Cards

### The landscape

Credit cards are the most expensive and most common form of consumer debt. They're also the most negotiable.

| Metric | United States | United Kingdom |
|---|---|---|
| Total outstanding debt | $1.277–$1.33 trillion | £76.1 billion |
| Average household balance | $11,019 | £2,572 |
| Average APR | 22.30% | 24.65% |
| Subprime / credit builder APR | 27.38% | 34.90% |
| Rewards card APR | ~22% | 36.20% |

### What makes credit cards dangerous

1. **Compounding interest on the revolving balance** — unlike a loan with a fixed end date, credit cards compound indefinitely
2. **Minimum payments designed to maximize interest extraction** (Chapter 1 covered this in detail)
3. **Variable rates** — your APR can increase without warning when benchmark rates rise
4. **Psychological ease** — tap-to-pay removes the "pain of payment" that cash provides

### Your credit card action plan

1. **Negotiate the rate** (Chapter 4, Step 1) — 83% success rate, 6.7-point average reduction
2. **Consider a balance transfer** (Chapter 4, Step 2) — 0% for 15–35 months
3. **Target these debts first** in your Snowball or Avalanche — they're almost always the highest APR
4. **Stop using the card** while paying it off — switch to debit or cash for daily spending
5. **Don't close the account** after paying it off — keep it open at $0 for credit utilization (Chapter 6)

> **UK-SPECIFIC: Persistent Debt Rules.** The FCA classifies you as in "persistent debt" if you've paid more in interest and fees than principal over 18 months. After 36 months of persistent debt, your provider *must* offer you a reasonable way to repay faster (such as a lower-rate loan). They may ultimately suspend your credit line. If you receive a persistent debt notice, respond — it's actually an opportunity to negotiate better terms.

### Common mistake

Paying off the card, feeling relief, then slowly running it back up. This is the #1 credit card failure pattern. If you can't trust yourself, freeze the card (literally — in a bag of ice in the freezer). The friction of thawing it prevents impulse purchases.

## Student Loans

Student loan strategy depends entirely on *where* you live and *what type* of loans you hold. The US and UK systems are radically different.

### United States: Federal Student Loans

**The current landscape (2026):**

The US federal student loan system is in turmoil. The SAVE Plan — which had offered the most generous income-driven repayment terms in history — was judicially blocked and dismantled. Starting July 1, 2026, newly disbursed federal loans will be restricted to two repayment options:

1. **Standard Repayment Plan:** Fixed payments over 10–25 years based on the total amount borrowed
2. **Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP):** A new income-driven plan with payments of 1–10% of Adjusted Gross Income, a $10/month floor, unpaid interest forgiveness, and a 30-year forgiveness timeline

Legacy plans (PAYE, ICR) sunset by July 2028. If you're currently enrolled in an old plan, you must proactively transition to RAP or the revised IBR before then — or your servicer will auto-enroll you, potentially into unfavorable terms.

**Federal loan action plan:**
1. **Know your servicer** — Log into StudentAid.gov to see all your federal loans, servicers, and current repayment plan
2. **Evaluate RAP** — If your income is moderate, RAP's interest forgiveness and 30-year timeline may be appropriate. Calculate your payment at 1–10% of AGI
3. **If pursuing PSLF** — Keep making qualifying payments. The 120-payment requirement hasn't changed. But verify annually at StudentAid.gov
4. **Never default** — Federal loans have extraordinary collection powers (wage garnishment, tax refund seizure, Social Security offset). If you can't pay, apply for an income-driven plan or forbearance immediately
5. **Extra payments go to principal** — If you're on the standard plan and can afford more, specify that extra payments apply to principal (not future payments)

> **CRITICAL:** Graduate and Parent PLUS borrowers face the harshest changes. Starting July 2026, Graduate Direct Unsubsidized Loans are capped at $20,500/year ($100,000 lifetime). Parent PLUS borrowers who take new loans after July 2026 — or who fail to consolidate existing loans before that date — will **lose all access to income-driven repayment**, forcing them into standard amortization regardless of income.

**Private student loans:** These have no income-driven options, no forgiveness, and limited hardship programs. If you hold private student loans at high rates, refinancing through a private lender (SoFi, Earnest, CommonBond) may lower your rate — but only if your credit score has improved since origination. Never refinance *federal* loans into private loans — you lose all federal protections.

### United Kingdom: Student Loans

UK student loans work more like a graduate tax than a traditional debt. You repay a percentage of income above a threshold, and the debt is written off after 25–40 years depending on your plan type.

**Current repayment thresholds (2025/2026):**

| Plan | Who It Applies To | Annual Threshold | Repayment Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| Plan 1 | Pre-2012 students | £26,065 | 9% of income above threshold |
| Plan 2 | 2012/13–2022/23 students | £28,470 | 9% of income above threshold |
| Plan 4 | Scottish students | £32,745 | 9% of income above threshold |
| Plan 5 | Post-August 2023 students | £25,000 | 9% of income above threshold |
| Plan 3 | Postgraduate loan | £21,000 | 6% of income above threshold |

*Source: GOV.UK, 2025/2026 guidelines*

**Important change for April 2026:** The Plan 2 threshold will increase slightly to £29,385, then be **frozen for three consecutive years** until April 2029. Because wages will rise while the threshold stays flat, this "fiscal drag" will progressively pull more of your income into the repayment bracket. Welsh graduates are exempt — the Welsh Government has refused to freeze the threshold.

**UK student loan action plan:**
1. **Don't overpay unless you'll clear the balance before write-off.** Most Plan 2 borrowers will never repay in full. MoneySavingExpert's student loan calculator shows whether overpaying makes sense for your specific situation.
2. **Check your plan type** at gov.uk/sign-in-to-manage-your-student-loan
3. **If you move abroad,** you must report your income to the Student Loans Company (SLC). The overseas repayment thresholds are set by the government and can be significantly lower than the UK threshold — for example, the Plan 2 threshold for graduates in Germany has been reduced to just **£23,510** (below the German minimum wage), effectively doubling monthly repayments for UK expats.
4. **Plan 5 loans** have a 40-year write-off period (vs. 30 years for Plan 2). This means most graduates on Plan 5 will repay more over their lifetime.

> **TIP:** For most UK graduates, student loan repayments are automatically deducted from your payslip. You don't need to actively manage them. The key decision is whether to make *voluntary* extra payments — and for most Plan 2 borrowers, the answer is no, because the remaining balance will be written off before you'd finish paying.

## Auto Loans

### The landscape

US auto loan balances total **$1.667 trillion**, with an average balance of **$24,596**. Auto loans are secured debt — meaning the car itself is collateral. This makes them lower-risk for lenders (and lower-rate for you), but it also means the car can be repossessed if you default.

### Auto loan action plan

1. **Refinancing** is the primary tool. If your credit score has improved since you bought the car, you may qualify for a significantly lower rate.
   - Wait at least **12 months** after purchase (the "seasoning" period — your score needs time to recover from the hard inquiry)
   - Ensure at least **24 months remain** on your current loan
   - Your car's value must exceed or be close to the loan balance (check Kelley Blue Book or Edmunds)
   - Fintech lenders (like Upstart) will refinance vehicles up to 12 model years old with up to 140,000 miles — traditional banks are stricter

2. **Don't extend the term** when refinancing. The goal is a lower rate at the same or shorter term. Extending from 36 months to 60 months lowers your payment but dramatically increases total interest — and risks putting you "underwater" (owing more than the car is worth).

3. **In your payoff strategy,** auto loans are usually moderate priority — lower APR than credit cards, but higher than student loans. Avalanche would place them in the middle.

4. **If you're struggling to make payments,** call the lender before you miss one. Many auto lenders offer temporary payment deferrals or modifications. A repossession devastates your credit for 7 years.

## Medical Debt

Medical debt is unique: it's involuntary, often negotiable, and subject to specific legal protections (especially in the US).

### United States

**The scale:** 36% of US households hold medical debt. Americans borrowed an estimated **$74 billion in a single year** to cover healthcare costs. The average household medical debt is **$10,570**.

**Your rights and opportunities:**

1. **Credit reporting protection:** Major credit bureaus no longer report medical debts **under $500** and provide a **one-year grace period** before unpaid medical collections appear on your report. This gives you significant negotiating leverage — you have time.

2. **Request an itemized bill.** Hospital "chargemaster" prices are arbitrarily inflated. Request a bill with specific CPT codes for every charge, then compare prices using the **FAIR Health Consumer database** (fairhealthconsumer.org) to see what the procedure should actually cost in your area.

3. **Apply for charity care.** If you were treated at a nonprofit hospital (the majority of US hospitals), federal law under **Section 501(r)** requires them to have a Financial Assistance Policy. Eligibility typically covers households up to 200% of the Federal Poverty Level ($30,120 for an individual, $62,400 for a family of four in 2026). Some hospitals go up to 400% or even 600% of FPL. **You must apply** — hospitals don't automatically grant it.

4. **Negotiate aggressively.** Hospitals and doctors' offices routinely accept **40–60% of the original bill** as full payment, especially if you can offer a lump sum. Always negotiate *before* the debt goes to collections.

5. **Catastrophic hardship exception:** Many hospitals offer additional discounts when a single bill exceeds **20% of annual household income**, regardless of your total earnings.

6. **Never put medical debt on a credit card.** You lose all negotiating leverage and convert a 0% obligation into a 22%+ one.

### United Kingdom

Historically, the NHS protected UK consumers from medical debt. That protection is eroding.

**NHS waiting lists** now exceed **7 million people**. Faced with months or years of waiting for treatment, over half of Britons resorting to private care face unfunded bills that can exceed **£50,000** for urgent diagnostics and treatments. A private MRI costs £400–£800. Cataract surgery averages £2,500 per eye.

**UK medical debt action plan:**
1. If you're on an NHS waiting list, ask your GP about the **NHS e-Referral Service** to find shorter wait times at different facilities
2. If you must go private, get written cost estimates before treatment
3. Finance carefully — a low-rate personal loan is almost always better than medical finance from the provider
4. Check if your employer offers private medical insurance as a benefit
5. If you're in debt from private treatment, contact **StepChange** — medical debt is increasingly common in their case load

## Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL)

### The shadow debt crisis

> **A NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR:** I worked as a data analyst at a BNPL company. I saw the internal numbers — the default rates, the repeat borrowing patterns, the demographic data showing exactly who was getting caught in the cycle. The external messaging said "flexible payments" and "interest-free convenience." The internal data told a different story entirely. The moment they launched BNPL for grocery shopping and food delivery, I knew the industry had crossed a line from convenience into exploitation. Everything in this section comes from that perspective: I've seen how this works from the inside.

BNPL has exploded into a massive, largely unregulated debt category that traditional credit monitoring can't see.

| Metric | United States | United Kingdom |
|---|---|---|
| Market size | $70 billion (2025), growing to $128B by 2026 | 50% of all UK adults have used BNPL |
| Users who budget for payments | Only 47% | — |
| Users paying late | 41% in the past year | — |
| Using BNPL for groceries | 25% (up from 14%) | 12% using BNPL for cost of living |
| Stacking BNPL + credit card debt | — | 33% of UK BNPL users |

*Sources: Richmond Fed; CFPB BNPL Market Report; Grant Thornton UK; The Motley Fool*

### Why BNPL is dangerous

1. **Invisible debt:** Most BNPL loans don't appear on credit reports. Lenders can't see them when assessing your creditworthiness, so you can stack loans endlessly.
2. **Fragmented payments:** Bi-weekly payment schedules misalign with monthly pay cycles. This causes cash-flow crunches and overdraft fees.
3. **Removes the pain of payment:** Research shows BNPL overrides your brain's natural cost-benefit assessment, leading to purchases you wouldn't otherwise make.
4. **Late fees escalate quickly:** Miss a Klarna or Afterpay payment and late fees can exceed the original purchase price on small items.

### BNPL escape plan

1. **Stop immediately.** Delete the apps. Remove them from your browser. No new BNPL purchases until all existing ones are cleared.
2. **List every BNPL obligation** — provider, balance, next payment date, payment amount (use the BNPL section of the Chapter 2 Debt Audit Worksheet)
3. **Build a 2-month forward budget** — because BNPL payments fall bi-weekly, you need to map them against your monthly income to see where the crunches are
4. **If the total is unmanageable,** consider a small personal consolidation loan to merge them into one predictable monthly payment (US: Discover, LendingClub — some offer APRs starting at 6.53% for qualified borrowers with direct-to-creditor disbursement)
5. **Include BNPL debts in your Snowball/Avalanche** — treat them as real debts with the priority they deserve

> **UK REGULATION UPDATE:** The FCA has confirmed that comprehensive BNPL regulation — including mandatory affordability checks — won't take full effect until **July 2026**. Until then, BNPL providers can lend with minimal checks. You are your own regulator. Treat every BNPL purchase as what it is: a loan.

## Mortgages

Mortgage debt is the largest obligation most people will ever carry. The strategies here aren't about paying off your mortgage early (that's a separate conversation) — they're about making sure your mortgage isn't preventing you from tackling higher-priority debts.

### United States: The Lock-In Effect

If you secured a mortgage at 2.5–3.5% during 2020–2022, you have an incredibly cheap loan. **Do not refinance** to access cash for debt payoff unless the math overwhelmingly supports it. Your mortgage rate is likely lower than any other borrowing option.

If you bought more recently at 6–8%, refinancing may become viable as rates decline. Watch your rate carefully.

**Key principle:** Your mortgage is almost always your lowest-priority debt in a payoff strategy. The interest rate is low, the interest is tax-deductible (US), and the asset typically appreciates. Focus on high-interest unsecured debt first.

### United Kingdom: The Remortgage Cliff

**1.8 million UK households** are due to remortgage in 2026. If your fixed rate is expiring, you'll transition from your low fixed rate to either a new fixed deal or the lender's Standard Variable Rate (SVR) — currently averaging **6.62%**.

**UK mortgage action plan:**
1. **Start shopping for a new deal 6 months before your fixed rate expires** — you can lock in a rate up to 6 months in advance
2. **Never default to the SVR** — it's almost always the most expensive option
3. **Consider overpaying your mortgage** only after all higher-interest debt is cleared
4. **If your remortgage increases your payment significantly,** adjust your debt payoff plan — keeping your home is always priority #1

---

## Personal Loans

Personal loans are fixed-term, fixed-rate installment loans. They're the simplest debt to manage — predictable payments, a defined end date, and typically moderate interest rates.

**When personal loans are fine:** If used for debt consolidation at a meaningfully lower rate than your credit cards.

**When personal loans are a problem:** If used to fund discretionary spending at high rates, or if you also carry credit card debt (meaning you have two sources of unsecured debt instead of one).

**Action plan:**
1. Personal loans fit naturally into your Snowball or Avalanche based on their balance and APR
2. Check if your loan has a prepayment penalty — most don't, but some do
3. If the rate is high (above 15%), consider refinancing once your credit score improves
4. Never take a new personal loan while you're already executing a debt payoff plan — it resets your progress

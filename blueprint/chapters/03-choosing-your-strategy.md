# Chapter 3 — Choosing Your Strategy

## Snowball vs. Avalanche — the definitive, data-backed guide

---

## Why This Chapter Matters

This is the most important decision you'll make in your entire debt payoff journey.

There are two proven strategies for eliminating multiple debts: the Debt Snowball and the Debt Avalanche. The internet is full of passionate arguments for both. Financial advisors disagree. Reddit threads go on for thousands of comments.

Here's the truth: both work. But they work *differently*, for *different people*, for *different reasons*. One saves you the most money. The other is more likely to get you to the finish line. And the academic research on which one actually produces better real-world results might surprise you.

This chapter gives you the full picture — with a complete worked example using real numbers, month-by-month comparison tables, the actual research from Harvard Business Review and Northwestern's Kellogg School of Management, and a simple decision framework so you can pick the right strategy for *you*.

**The transformation:** You'll go from "I don't know where to start" to "I know exactly which debt to attack first, why, and when I'll be debt-free."

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Understand the Two Strategies

Both strategies share the same foundation: you make the minimum payment on every debt, then throw all your extra money at **one specific target debt**. The difference is how you choose that target.

**The Debt Avalanche (Math-First)**

Order your debts from **highest interest rate to lowest**. Attack the highest-rate debt first.

- Logic: Eliminates the most expensive debt first, minimizing total interest paid
- Best for: People who are motivated by math, who have high discipline, and whose highest-rate debts aren't overwhelmingly large
- Downside: If your highest-rate debt has a massive balance, you might go months (or years) without the satisfaction of closing an account

**The Debt Snowball (Psychology-First)**

Order your debts from **smallest balance to largest**. Attack the smallest balance first, regardless of interest rate.

- Logic: Creates quick wins that build psychological momentum
- Best for: People who need motivation, who have multiple small debts, or who've tried and failed to pay off debt before
- Downside: You may pay more in total interest by ignoring higher-rate debts temporarily

> **KEY INSIGHT:** Both strategies use the same total monthly payment. The only difference is the *order* you attack debts. When you pay off Debt #1 and its minimum payment is freed up, you "snowball" or "avalanche" that freed-up cash into Debt #2. This creates an accelerating effect — each payoff makes the next one faster.

### Step 2: See Both Strategies in Action

Let's use the Martinez family from Chapters 1 and 2. After their audit, they identified they can put **$1,200/month total** toward debt — $936 in minimums plus $264 in extra payments.

**The Martinez Family's Debts (sorted by APR for Avalanche):**

| Debt | Balance | APR | Minimum |
|---|---|---|---|
| Target RedCard | $2,100 | 27.49% | $42 |
| Chase Visa | $8,200 | 24.99% | $164 |
| Ford Auto Loan | $14,800 | 6.90% | $345 |
| Federal Student Loans | $28,500 | 5.50% | $310 |
| Medical Bill | $1,800 | 0% | $75 |
| Medical (Collections) | $340 | 0% | $0 |
| **Total** | **$55,740** | | **$936** |

Extra monthly payment available: **$264**

---

**AVALANCHE ORDER** (highest APR first):

1. Target RedCard ($2,100 at 27.49%) — gets the $264 extra
2. Chase Visa ($8,200 at 24.99%)
3. Ford Auto Loan ($14,800 at 6.90%)
4. Student Loans ($28,500 at 5.50%)
5. Medical Bill ($1,800 at 0%)
6. Medical Collections ($340 at 0%)

**SNOWBALL ORDER** (smallest balance first):

1. Medical Collections ($340 at 0%) — gets the $264 extra
2. Medical Bill ($1,800 at 0%)
3. Target RedCard ($2,100 at 27.49%)
4. Chase Visa ($8,200 at 24.99%)
5. Ford Auto Loan ($14,800 at 6.90%)
6. Student Loans ($28,500 at 5.50%)

### Step 3: Compare the Results

Here's what happens when we run both strategies through to completion:

**Head-to-Head Comparison:**

| Metric | Avalanche | Snowball | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Total time to debt-free** | **53 months** (4 yr 5 mo) | **55 months** (4 yr 7 mo) | Avalanche wins by 2 months |
| **Total interest paid** | **$9,847** | **$10,412** | Avalanche saves **$565** |
| **First debt eliminated** | Month 7 (Target RedCard) | Month 2 (Medical Collections) | Snowball wins by 5 months |
| **Second debt eliminated** | Month 12 (Medical Collections*) | Month 8 (Medical Bill) | Snowball wins by 4 months |
| **Debts closed in first year** | 2 | 3 | Snowball wins |
| **Monthly "extra" by month 12** | $306 | $381 | Snowball is rolling faster |

*Calculated using standard amortization schedules with $1,200/month total payment*

**The math says:** Avalanche saves $565 and finishes 2 months sooner.

**The psychology says:** Snowball closes its first debt in Month 2 vs. Month 7, giving you a tangible win *five months earlier*. By month 12, the Snowball has closed 3 accounts. The Avalanche has closed 2.

### Step 4: The Avalanche Month-by-Month (First 12 Months)

| Month | Target RedCard | Chase Visa | Auto Loan | Student Loans | Medical Bill | Medical Coll. | Total Paid |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | $2,100 | $8,200 | $14,800 | $28,500 | $1,800 | $340 | — |
| 1 | $1,788 | $8,207 | $14,540 | $28,321 | $1,725 | $340 | $1,200 |
| 3 | $1,150 | $8,218 | $14,015 | $27,960 | $1,575 | $340 | $3,600 |
| 6 | $169 | $8,228 | $13,217 | $27,410 | $1,350 | $340 | $7,200 |
| 7 | **PAID OFF** | $8,060 | $12,948 | $27,225 | $1,275 | $340 | $8,400 |
| 8 | ✓ | $7,667 | $12,677 | $27,038 | $1,200 | $340 | $9,600 |
| 12 | ✓ | $5,951 | $11,575 | $26,282 | $900 | **PAID OFF** | $14,400 |

After the Target RedCard is eliminated in month 7, its $306/month ($42 minimum + $264 extra) rolls into the Chase Visa. The payment on Chase jumps from $164 to $470/month.

---

### Step 5: The Snowball Month-by-Month (First 12 Months)

| Month | Medical Coll. | Medical Bill | Target RedCard | Chase Visa | Auto Loan | Student Loans | Total Paid |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | $340 | $1,800 | $2,100 | $8,200 | $14,800 | $28,500 | — |
| 1 | $76 | $1,725 | $2,106 | $8,207 | $14,540 | $28,321 | $1,200 |
| 2 | **PAID OFF** | $1,650 | $2,112 | $8,213 | $14,277 | $28,140 | $2,400 |
| 3 | ✓ | $1,311 | $2,117 | $8,219 | $14,013 | $27,957 | $3,600 |
| 8 | ✓ | **PAID OFF** | $2,138 | $8,237 | $12,658 | $27,015 | $9,600 |
| 9 | ✓ | ✓ | $1,779 | $8,238 | $12,385 | $26,822 | $10,800 |
| 12 | ✓ | ✓ | $633 | $8,230 | $11,554 | $26,234 | $14,400 |

The Snowball's power is visible immediately: Medical Collections gone in month 2, Medical Bill gone in month 8. By month 9, the Martinez family is directing $381/month at the Target RedCard ($42 min + $339 freed from closed debts). It falls fast.

### Step 6: Understand What the Research Proves

This isn't just about math vs. feelings. Serious academic research has studied which approach *actually works* in the real world.

**Study 1: Kellogg School of Management (Northwestern University)**

Researchers Blakeley McShane and David Gal analyzed the debt repayment behaviors of **6,000 consumers** enrolled in structured debt programs through Freedom Financial Network.

Their key finding: **The single strongest predictor of successful debt elimination was the proportion of individual accounts closed** — not the total dollar amount paid down. Consumers who experienced early "small victories" by closing small accounts showed significantly higher persistence and were far more likely to complete their entire debt payoff plan.

The dollar amount of debt eliminated? Not predictive of success. It was the *account closures* that mattered.

**Study 2: Harvard Business Review / Journal of Consumer Research**

Remi Trudel (Boston University) and colleagues conducted multiple field experiments studying how consumers allocate payments across debts. Their findings:

- **Concentrated strategies** (focusing all extra money on one debt) dramatically outperform **dispersed strategies** (spreading extra money across all debts)
- The critical psychological trigger is **proportional balance reduction** — not the dollar amount paid, but the *percentage* of a specific debt eliminated
- Paying $500 toward a $1,000 balance (50% reduction) generates far more motivation than paying $500 toward a $10,000 balance (5% reduction) — even if the $10,000 balance has a higher interest rate

**What this means for you:**

The Snowball method maximizes proportional balance reductions and account closures. The Avalanche minimizes interest cost. Both beat the alternative — which is doing nothing, or spreading payments evenly across everything (the worst approach).

> **STAT BOX:** In a comprehensive analysis using Federal Reserve Survey of Consumer Finance data, the Avalanche method saved approximately **$1,000 more** over the life of a multi-debt payoff plan compared to the Snowball. But the Snowball method's capacity to trigger habit-forming behavior and deliver rapid psychological wins makes it a **far more reliable predictor of total debt elimination** for the average consumer. The $1,000 saved by the Avalanche is irrelevant if you quit in month 8.

### Step 7: Choose Your Strategy

Use this decision framework:

**Choose the AVALANCHE if:**
- [ ] You're highly disciplined and self-motivated
- [ ] You've successfully completed long-term financial goals before
- [ ] Your highest-rate debt has a manageable balance (under $5,000)
- [ ] The interest rate gap between your debts is large (e.g., 25% vs. 6%)
- [ ] You're motivated by saving money more than by quick wins

**Choose the SNOWBALL if:**
- [ ] You've tried to pay off debt before and quit
- [ ] You have several small debts (under $1,000) you can knock out quickly
- [ ] You need early wins to stay motivated
- [ ] You feel overwhelmed by the total amount you owe
- [ ] Your interest rates are fairly similar across debts

**Choose a HYBRID if:**
- [ ] You have one very small debt AND one very high-interest debt
- [ ] You want the psychological benefit of a quick win, then the mathematical benefit of rate prioritization

**The Hybrid approach:** Pay off one or two of your smallest debts first (for momentum), then switch to Avalanche order for the rest. You get the motivational boost of early closures without sacrificing too much in interest.

> **TIP:** There is no wrong choice between Snowball and Avalanche. The *wrong* choice is not choosing at all, or spreading your extra payments evenly across everything. Concentration — picking ONE target and hammering it — is what the research proves works. Pick a strategy. Commit. Start.

## Worked Example: The Martinez Family Decision

Maria and Carlos look at their numbers:

**For Avalanche:** Their highest-rate debt is the Target RedCard at 27.49%, with a balance of $2,100. That's actually a small balance *and* the highest rate. Lucky — in this case, the Avalanche starts with a quick win too.

**For Snowball:** Their smallest debt is the Medical Collections at $340. That's a one-month kill. Immediate satisfaction.

**Their decision:** They choose the **Hybrid** approach.

- **Month 1–2:** Kill the $340 Medical Collections (Snowball start — instant win)
- **Month 3 onward:** Switch to Avalanche — attack the Target RedCard (27.49%), then the Chase Visa (24.99%), then systematically through the rest by interest rate

This gives them:
- First win in month 2 (Medical Collections: gone)
- Second win in month 9 (Target RedCard: gone, saving maximum interest)
- Total interest paid: approximately $9,920 — nearly as good as pure Avalanche
- Three accounts closed in the first year — the motivational benefit of the Snowball

**Their projected debt-free date: Month 54 (4 years, 6 months from today)**

They enter the strategy in the StackedSheets Debt Payoff Tracker. The Dashboard shows their payoff date. The Milestones tab marks each account closure. The Countdown tab starts ticking.

Game on.

## Key Takeaways

- **Avalanche** (highest APR first) saves the most money; **Snowball** (smallest balance first) creates the most momentum — both beat doing nothing
- The research is clear: **account closures and proportional balance reduction** are the strongest predictors of long-term success — this favors the Snowball for most people
- **Never spread extra payments across all debts equally** — concentration is the key to acceleration
- The **Hybrid** approach (knock out one or two quick wins, then switch to Avalanche) gives you the best of both worlds
- The interest difference between strategies is typically **$500–$2,000** on moderate debt loads — real money, but far less than the cost of quitting
- **Pick a strategy and commit.** The worst strategy is no strategy.

## Quick Win (30–60 Minutes)

**Run your personal Snowball vs. Avalanche comparison:**

1. Open the StackedSheets Debt Payoff Tracker (or use an online calculator)
2. Enter all your debts from your Chapter 2 audit
3. Enter your total monthly payment amount (minimums + extra)
4. Check the **Snowball tab** — note: total interest, payoff date, first account closed
5. Check the **Avalanche tab** — note: total interest, payoff date, first account closed
6. Compare the two. The difference might be smaller than you expect.
7. **Make your choice.** Write it down: "My strategy is ____________."

Done. You now have a strategy. Chapter 4 shows you how to turbocharge it.

## 1-Week Action Plan

**Day 1:** Review your Debt Audit Worksheet from Chapter 2. Rank your debts two ways: by APR (highest first) and by balance (smallest first).

**Day 2:** Enter everything into the StackedSheets Debt Payoff Tracker. Run both Snowball and Avalanche projections.

**Day 3:** Calculate the difference. How much more interest does the Snowball cost? How much sooner does it close the first account? Write both numbers down.

**Day 4:** Be honest with yourself. Have you tried (and failed) at long-term financial goals before? Are you highly disciplined, or do you need frequent wins? Read the decision framework again.

**Day 5:** Make your choice: Snowball, Avalanche, or Hybrid. Write it at the top of your Debt Audit Worksheet.

**Day 6:** Identify your Target Debt #1 — the first debt you're going to destroy. Write its name, balance, APR, and your target payoff date somewhere visible.

**Day 7:** Set up the extra payment. If it's an additional $264/month (like the Martinez family), schedule it. Automate it if possible. Then read Chapter 4 — because the amount you're paying is about to get a lot bigger.

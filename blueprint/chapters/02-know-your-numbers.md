# Chapter 2 — Know Your Numbers

## Audit every debt and face the full picture

## Why This Chapter Matters

You can't build a plan to eliminate something you can't see clearly.

Most people in debt have a rough idea of what they owe. They know the big ones — the mortgage, the car loan, maybe the credit card that's been creeping up. But they're fuzzy on the exact numbers. They've never sat down and listed every single obligation in one place. And they've certainly never calculated their total monthly interest cost or their debt-to-income ratio.

That vagueness is expensive. It prevents you from choosing the right strategy (Chapter 3), spotting negotiation opportunities (Chapter 7), and tracking whether you're actually making progress. It also feeds anxiety — the unknown is always scarier than the known.

This chapter ends the guessing. By the time you finish, you'll have every debt documented, your credit report reviewed, your debt-to-income ratio calculated, and your StackedSheets Debt Payoff Tracker set up and ready to go.

**The transformation:** You'll go from "I think I owe around..." to "I owe exactly $X across Y accounts, paying $Z in monthly interest, and my debt-to-income ratio is W%."

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Find Every Debt You Owe

Most people miss debts. Old medical bills in collections. A personal loan from three years ago. A Buy Now, Pay Later plan they forgot about. A store card they opened for the 15% discount and never thought about again.

Here's how to find everything:

**Source 1: Your credit report**

This is the master list. Your credit report shows every credit account, loan, and collection reported to the bureaus.

- **US:** Go to AnnualCreditReport.com. Pull reports from all three bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion). They sometimes report different accounts, so you need all three.
- **UK:** Sign up for all three — ClearScore (Equifax), Credit Karma UK (TransUnion), and the Experian app. Each is free. Each shows a different bureau's data.

For each account listed, write down:
- Creditor name
- Account type (credit card, personal loan, student loan, auto loan, etc.)
- Current balance
- Monthly payment
- Interest rate (if shown)
- Account status (current, delinquent, in collections)

**Source 2: Your bank and card statements**

Log into every bank account and credit card account you have. Check:
- Outstanding balances on all credit cards
- Any automatic loan payments (these reveal loans you might have forgotten)
- Recurring BNPL payments (Klarna, Afterpay, Clearpay, Zip)

**Source 3: Your email inbox**

Search for: "statement," "payment due," "balance," "Klarna," "Afterpay," "loan," "collections." Old emails often surface debts that fell off your radar.

**Source 4: Your mail and phone**

Check for physical statements and voicemails from collectors. If a creditor has been calling, that's a debt you need to account for.

> **TIP:** BNPL debts (Klarna, Afterpay, Clearpay, Zip, Sezzle) often don't appear on credit reports. You must check each app individually. Log in to every BNPL service you've ever used and check for outstanding balances. These hidden debts are real debts — and they're the ones most likely to blindside your budget.

### Step 2: Read Your Credit Report (Without Panicking)

Your credit report can look intimidating. Here's what actually matters:

**What to look for:**

1. **Accounts you recognize:** Verify the balances are approximately correct. Minor discrepancies between the report and your latest statement are normal (reporting dates differ).

2. **Accounts you DON'T recognize:** This could be identity theft, a joint account you forgot about, or an old debt sold to a collections agency under a different name. Flag these for investigation.

3. **Accounts in collections:** These are debts that the original creditor gave up on and sold to a third-party collector. They still count. Write them down.

4. **Errors:** The FTC estimates that **1 in 5 Americans** has an error on at least one credit report. Common errors include:
   - Accounts that aren't yours
   - Incorrect balances or credit limits
   - Closed accounts reported as open
   - Duplicate accounts
   - Incorrect delinquency reporting

5. **Hard inquiries:** These show who's been checking your credit. They're informational — not debts — but worth reviewing.

**How to dispute errors:**

- **US:** File disputes directly through each bureau's website (Experian, Equifax, TransUnion). They have 30 days to investigate. If the creditor can't verify the debt, it must be removed.
- **UK:** Contact the credit reference agency (CRA) through their app or website. They'll raise a dispute with the creditor. You can also add a "notice of correction" — a short statement explaining your circumstances — that lenders must read.

**Your credit score (just for reference — don't obsess):**

Your credit score will be visible on your free reports. Note it, but don't fixate on it. Chapter 6 explains exactly how your score will move during payoff and what to do about it. For now, your only job is to document what you owe.

### Step 3: Organize Everything in One Place

Now take everything you've found and organize it. You have two options:

**Option A: The Debt Audit Worksheet** (at the end of this chapter)

Print it out and fill it in by hand. Simple, tangible, and effective. Research shows that writing things down physically increases commitment and recall.

**Option B: The StackedSheets Debt Payoff Tracker** (included with this Blueprint)

This is the more powerful option. The tracker does the math for you and shows your full payoff timeline.

**Setting up the tracker:**

1. Open the DebtPayoffTracker file in Excel or Google Sheets
2. Go to the **"Debts"** tab
3. For each debt, enter:
   - Debt name (e.g., "Chase Visa," "Ford auto loan," "Sallie Mae")
   - Category (use the emoji categories: 💳 Credit Card, 🎓 Student Loan, 🚗 Auto, 🏠 Mortgage, 💰 Personal, 🏥 Medical, 📦 Other)
   - Current balance
   - Interest rate (APR)
   - Minimum monthly payment
4. The tracker automatically populates the **Dashboard**, **Snowball**, and **Avalanche** tabs
5. Check the **Dashboard** to see your total debt, total monthly payments, and projected payoff dates

> **TIP:** If you don't know the exact interest rate on a debt, check your latest statement, log into the account online, or call the creditor and ask. This number is critical — it determines everything in Chapters 3 and 4.

### Step 4: Calculate Your Debt-to-Income Ratio

Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes to debt payments. It's the single best measure of how leveraged you are.

**The formula:**

**DTI = (Total Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Gross Monthly Income) × 100**

**Example — The Martinez Family (from Chapter 1):**

- Total monthly debt payments: $936
- Gross monthly income (before tax): $7,800
- DTI = ($936 ÷ $7,800) × 100 = **12.0%**

**What your DTI means:**

| DTI Range | What It Means |
|---|---|
| **Under 15%** | Manageable. You have room to accelerate payments. |
| **15–25%** | Getting tight. You need a clear strategy and should be aggressive about reducing rates. |
| **25–35%** | Stressed. You're at risk if anything unexpected happens. Priority: emergency fund + strategy selection. |
| **35–50%** | Danger zone. Most of your income is committed. Negotiation (Chapter 7) and possibly professional help are essential. |
| **Over 50%** | Crisis. Seek nonprofit credit counseling immediately (US: NFCC.org / UK: StepChange.org). You may need a formal debt management plan. |

*Note: This calculation includes all debt payments — credit cards, loans, mortgage/rent, BNPL — but NOT utilities, groceries, or insurance.*

> **IMPORTANT:** If your DTI is over 50%, you are not failing — you're surviving in a system that's stacked against you. The strategies in this Blueprint still apply, but you may also benefit from professional support. Both the National Foundation for Credit Counseling (US: nfcc.org) and StepChange (UK: stepchange.org) offer free, confidential debt advice. They negotiate directly with creditors on your behalf and can set up formal Debt Management Plans at reduced interest rates.

### Step 5: Understand Good Debt vs. Bad Debt

Not all debt is equal. Understanding the difference helps you prioritize.

**"Good" debt (use it, don't abuse it):**
- Mortgage — builds equity in an appreciating asset (usually)
- Student loans — invests in earning potential (at reasonable amounts)
- Business loans — generates income that exceeds the interest cost

**"Bad" debt (eliminate this first):**
- Credit cards — high interest, depreciating purchases
- Store cards — extremely high APR (often 25%+), impulse-driven
- Payday loans — predatory APRs (often 300%+)
- BNPL loans — hidden obligations that fragment your budget
- Auto loans on depreciating cars at high APR

**The grey zone:**
- Auto loans at reasonable rates (<6%) on reliable transportation — necessary evil
- Medical debt — involuntary, often negotiable (see Chapter 5)
- Personal loans used for consolidation — depends on the math (see Chapter 4)

The key principle: **Pay off the debt that's costing you the most and giving you the least.** Credit cards and store cards almost always top the list.

## Worked Example: The Martinez Family Audit

Let's complete the full audit for our example family from Chapter 1.

**Step 1: Maria pulls all three credit reports.**
She discovers a $340 medical collection she didn't know about — an old copay from a specialist visit two years ago. That makes six debts total.

**Step 2: She checks the BNPL apps.**
No outstanding balances. (She canceled Klarna last month after reading about the interest charges.)

**Step 3: She organizes everything:**

| # | Creditor | Type | Balance | APR | Min. Payment | Annual Interest |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Chase Visa | 💳 Credit card | $8,200 | 24.99% | $164 | $2,049 |
| 2 | Target RedCard | 💳 Store card | $2,100 | 27.49% | $42 | $577 |
| 3 | Ford Motor Credit | 🚗 Auto loan | $14,800 | 6.90% | $345 | $1,021 |
| 4 | FedLoan | 🎓 Student loan | $28,500 | 5.50% | $310 | $1,568 |
| 5 | Regional Hospital | 🏥 Medical bill | $1,800 | 0% | $75 | $0 |
| 6 | ABC Collections | 🏥 Medical (coll.) | $340 | 0% | $0 | $0 |
| | **TOTALS** | | **$55,740** | | **$936** | **$5,215** |

**Step 4: DTI calculation**
- Monthly payments: $936
- Gross income: $7,800/month
- DTI: **12.0%** — Manageable range, with room to accelerate

**Step 5: Priority classification**
- Eliminate first: Target RedCard (27.49% APR) and Chase Visa (24.99% APR) — high-interest bad debt
- Manage: Auto loan and student loans — lower rates, building credit history
- Negotiate: Both medical debts — Chapter 7 covers how to potentially reduce or eliminate these

**Maria's "interest tax": $5,215 per year — or $435 per month.**

That $435/month in pure interest is their biggest target. Every rate reduction, every extra payment, every strategy in the following chapters is aimed at shrinking that number to zero.
